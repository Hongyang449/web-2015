# Day 3. Data Formats and Visualization

A large fraction of biological science in these days involves
analysis of genomic data.

There are many *de facto* standards for
representing genomic data, including but not limited to,
FASTA, FASTQ, SAM/BAM, VCF, GTF, and BED formats.
The ability to read and manipulate data files stored in these formats
is one of the key skill sets needed for genome scientists.

Effective visualization of the genomic data and its analysis outcome is a
key component for successful communication in the research community
handling a large amount of genomic data.

Today, we will learn the widely used genomic data formats and
practice how to read and manipulate the data in these formats. We will
also learn the basics of data visualization with practice on real data.
