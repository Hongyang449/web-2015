# Day 1. Introduction to UNIX
Most bioinformatics happens on Unix/Linux platforms but why and how do we use Unix?

Increasingly, the raw output of biological research exists as _in silico_ data, usually in the form of large text files. Unix is particularly suited to working with such files and has many powerful (and flexible) commands that can process your data for you. 

The real strength of learning Unix is that most of these commands can be combined in an almost unlimited fashion. So if you can learn just five Unix commands, you will be able to do a lot more than just five things. Our objective here is to learn a subset of Unix and to become a productive Unix user without knowing or using every program and feature.
