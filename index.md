### Introduction to Biocomputing (BIOS/BIOI/HG 606) 

**Overview:** This hands-on boot camp introduces computational tools, techniques and best practices to graduate students with limited prior experience.

**Description:** Concepts and tools covered include the Unix system, version control, data management, software compilation and task automation. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. Our tools of choice will be Python for programming and git for version control, but the lessons learned should be widely applicable for those looking to incorporate more productive computational methods into their daily research work.

**Audience:** Students with little/no UNIX experience and no formal programming training

**Where:** Some room in Biostats, August 24-28, 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM 

**Requirements:** Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed (listed [here](/setup/)).
